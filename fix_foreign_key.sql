-- Fix the foreign key constraint for profiles table
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor

-- 1. Check current foreign key constraint
SELECT 
    tc.constraint_name, 
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name, 
    ccu.table_schema AS foreign_table_schema,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
FROM 
    information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
    JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
      ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
      AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
    JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
      ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
      AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' 
AND tc.table_name='profiles';

-- 2. Drop the incorrect foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE profiles DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS profiles_id_fkey;

-- 3. Create the correct foreign key to auth.users
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD CONSTRAINT profiles_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (id) 
REFERENCES auth.users(id) 
ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- 4. Verify the fix
SELECT 
    tc.constraint_name, 
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name, 
    ccu.table_schema AS foreign_table_schema,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
FROM 
    information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
    JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
      ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
      AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
    JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
      ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
      AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' 
AND tc.table_name='profiles';

-- Should now show foreign_table_schema as 'auth' and foreign_table_name as 'users'
